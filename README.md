# RSA accumulators

Modified version of [accumulator](https://github.com/cambrian/accumulator) that allows accumulating without hash-to-prime and exposes additional info needed for the protocols in [CPSNARKs-Set](https://github.com/matteocam/cpsnarks-set).

Cryptographic accumulators in Rust, implemented over a generic group interface. Batteries (RSA and
class group implementations) included!

## Installation
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
accumulator = { git = "https://github.com/matteocam/accumulator.git" }
```
